# Java Starter

A Java seed project for Bolt.

## Getting started

First, clone the Bolt project and install it to your local Maven repository.

```shell
git clone https://github.com/kshep92/bolt.git
cd bolt
./gradlew install
```

Now you should be able to add Bolt as a dependency to your project. 

Happy coding!
