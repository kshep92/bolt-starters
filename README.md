# Bolt starter projects

Seed projects for Bolt framework.

## Getting started

First, clone the Bolt project and install it to your local Maven repository.

```shell
git clone https://github.com/kshep92/bolt.git
cd bolt
./gradlew install
```

Now you should be able to add Bolt as a dependency to your project as well as use any
of these project templates. 

More templates will be added soon.

Happy coding!
